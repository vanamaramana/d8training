# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses http://drupal8.dev/d8-custom/hello, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\d8_custom\Controller\D8CustomController")
# and a method ("controller_method_name").
d8_custom.d8_custom_controller_controller_method_name:
  path: 'd8-custom/hello'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\d8_custom\Controller\D8CustomController::controller_method_name'
    _title: 'controller_method_title'
  requirements:
